=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Action::Serialize - Serialize Data in a Response

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Foo::Controller::Bar;

    __PACKAGE__->config(
        'default'   => 'text/x-yaml',
        'stash_key' => 'rest',
        'map'       => {
            'text/html'          => [ 'View', 'TT', ],
            'text/x-yaml'        => 'YAML',
            'text/x-data-dumper' => [ 'Data::Serializer', 'Data::Dumper' ],
        }
    );

    sub end :ActionClass('Serialize') {}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This action will serialize the body of an HTTP Response.  The serializer is
selected by introspecting the HTTP Requests content-type header.

It requires that your Catalyst controller is properly configured to set up the
mapping between Content Type's and Serialization classes.

The specifics of serializing each content-type is implemented as a plugin to
L<Catalyst::Action::Serialize>.

Typically, you would use this ActionClass on your C<end> method.  However,
nothing is stopping you from choosing specific methods to Serialize:

  sub foo :Local :ActionClass('Serialize') {
     .. populate stash with data ..
  }

When you use this module, the request class will be changed to
L<Catalyst::Request::REST>.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

=head2 map

Takes a hashref, mapping Content-Types to a given serializer plugin.

=head2 default

This is the 'fall-back' Content-Type if none of the requested or acceptable
types is found in the L</map>. It must be an entry in the L</map>.

=head2 stash_key

Specifies the key of the stash entry holding the data that is to be serialized.
So if the value is "rest", we will serialize the data under:

  $c->stash->{'rest'}

=head2 content_type_stash_key

Specifies the key of the stash entry that optionally holds an overriding
Content-Type. If set, and if the specified stash entry has a valid value,
then it takes priority over the requested content types.

This can be useful if you want to dynamically force a particular content type,
perhaps for debugging.

=head1 HELPFUL PEOPLE

Daisuke Maki pointed out that early versions of this Action did not play
well with others, or generally behave in a way that was very consistent
with the rest of Catalyst.

=head1 SEE ALSO

You likely want to look at L<Catalyst::Controller::REST>, which implements
a sensible set of defaults for doing a REST controller.
